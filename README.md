LiDAR Code:
-

- LoRaWAN_Transmitter: implemented code for the transmission prototype for sending packets over LoRaWAN network protocol to our The Things Network server.
- Receiver: for the simulated gateway receiver to display received messages from transmitter prototype.
- Transmitter: very simple code for the transmission prototype only using LoRa.h library for point-to-point communication. I will need to implement the arduino-lmco library to update this code for the transmitter prototype such that it will integrate LoRaWAN network protocol abilities.
