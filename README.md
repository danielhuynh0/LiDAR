LiDAR Code:
-

- Receiver: for the simulated gateway receiver to display received messages from transmitter prototype.
- Transmitter: very simple code for the transmission prototype only using LoRa.h library for point-to-point communication. I will need to implement the arduino-lmco library to update this code for the transmitter prototype such that it will integrate LoRaWAN network protocol abilities.
